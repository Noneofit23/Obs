# Vision, Identity, Purpose & Principles ⚙️

## Visions 🔮

I learn how to programme and become a dev. I live in a cosy flat with my gf and our cat in Lyon close to my friends.
## Identity 🪪

I'm a fit geek who loves hiking. I'm kind and helpful.

## Purpose ✨

I want to keep learning things my whole life.

I want to bring joy, and leave this world in a better state.

## Principles 🪨

> [!QUOTE]- I don't bother about things I can't control.
> Past, future, others, all of these things are out of my control. I can just accept them and live with it. ~Stoicism.

> [!QUOTE]- I think a bit, I do a whole lot more
> - Thinking and learning is good but it is motion. You still need to take actions and focus on the things you want, you can't do everything, and it can't be perfect. ~Atomic Habits
>
> - Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become, meaning changing your habits is changing your identity. On the other way, changing the way you see yourself helps acting toward that new identity. ~ Atomic Habits

> [!QUOTE]- I never miss twice
> If you miss once it's just an accident. If you miss twice, it's a new habit with a vicious circle starting. ~Atomic Habits
