# README

As I promised to quite a few people on different places, I’m releasing a [full blown guide](https://mathisgauthey.github.io/my-complete-obsidian-workflow-to-manage-my-life/) of my Obsidian workflow. It has many cool features that I’ve seen people struggling with online :

1. Tasks and project management with journaling, workout logging and media tracking. Using daily and periodic notes.
2. Read-it-later with automated conversion to markdown and import inside your vault. Meaning all your past knowledge is inside Obsidian, available with a simple search alongside your notes.
3. Fast and simple one click upload obsidian publish alternative.

But there’s plenty more. It took me some time here and there during the past year to come up with this setup. And don’t worry, it is **easy to use** despite its awfully long name. But I’ll describe it with as much depth as I can for people who wants to fine tune it.

Obviously, it is merely just a starting point, with Obsidian you can (and you always should) do something that works well for **you**. And that means creating your **own** setup. But that doesn’t forbid you from using this one as a starting-point.

→ I encourage you to take a look at the 2023-08-06 daily note to see the task capabilities in action.
